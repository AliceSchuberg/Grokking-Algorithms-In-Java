# -Java-
Java Project in progress for the book 《Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people》

The book was written based on Python, which somewhat hindered my understanding of how it worked
(python provides too many built-in functions XD), then I thought why not wrote it down in Java, so here comes the project
